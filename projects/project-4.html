    <p>Automation, innovation and competitive business models are transforming the world of work. As a result employers seek entry level talent which can perform functions and contribute towards growth beyond just their technical competence. They give preference in hiring 'smart generalists' with proficiency in 21st century workplace skills such as creative thinking, emotional intelligence, problem solving, critical thinking and an entrepreneurial mindset. Just a degree is no longer an adequate starting point. </p>
    <p>However, a majority of India's job seeking students hail from lower middle income groups and Category B & C colleges where the required access and resources to provide this exposure is often limited. As a result of this youth, especially women, from economically disadvantaged communities are often left behind in receiving opportunities to build aspirational careers in high growth Startups or MNCs. Instead they must settle for jobs or roles far below their true potential and end up focusing on survival instead of growth.</p>
    <p>To bridge this gap, Project Naveli & X Billion Skills Lab have collaborated to launch Nimaya with support of the United Nations. Our aim is to identify girls from lower income backgrounds who display high potential and put them through an engaging e-learning journey that trains them in essential 21st century workplace skills and then provides job access. The training includes animated modules, masterclasses with CEOs, personal mentors and situational based judgement tests. Very simply put, the idea is to take high quality learning to target groups that need it the most in relatable and engaging formats. </p>
