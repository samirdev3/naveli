<h3 class="nl--title">Period Positive Homes</h3>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    This project was based in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra. A tribal village where
    they practice an extremely unsanitary & backwards custom called "Banishment
    to a Gaokar". Gadchiroli, categorised as a tribal district, undeveloped,
    naxal affected, is one of the 250 most-backward districts in the country, as
    designated by Govt. of India. Given its location in the heart of Central
    India, and farming as the main occupation, there is little to no mainstream
    industry, and household livelihoods are dependent on agriculture, daily wage
    labour, opportunities related to forest resources. The Economic Survey of
    Maharashtra, 2017 to 2018, states that Gadchirolihas the lowest annual
    household income ie Rs 78,863/-, ( monthly income Rs 6572/- ), amongst the
    34 districts in the state of Maharashtra

  <h3 class="nl--title">Background and need of the project</h3>
  <p>
    Introduction to a traditional and unhealthy practice called “Banished to a
    Gaokor” – A hut outside the village where women and girls are banished
    during menstruation. These huts are public property and no one takes
    responsibility to maintain them in a hygienic manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Period Huts, an aged old custom amongst the Madia/ Gond tribes, originating
    from the belief that menstruation is impure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Banishing menstruating women to Period Huts/Kurma Ghars is an unhealthy
    practice amongst certain tribes in Gadchiroli. Out of the 223 Period Huts
    surveyed, 98 % were found to be unsafe, unhygienic, inhabitable shelters
    having no electricity, toilet /bath facilities, water supply, causing
    infections, illnesses and sometimes death amongst menstruating women.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the monsoons, it is all the more difficult to stay in gaokor because
    water percolates inside the homes and roofs leak occasionally. Since the
    huts are considered public property, no one takes responsibility for their
    upkeep. Gaokors lack a kitchen as women who are menstruating are not allowed
    to cook; those staying inside rely on family to bring them food and other
    items.
  </p>
  <p>
    Women usually sleep on the floor with a thick sheet as a make do mattress,
    which is folded and used as a cushion during the day. Given the location of
    the huts, it is common for wild animals to make an appearance, and there
    have been reports of women dying from snakebites while staying in gaokors.

  <h3 class="nl--title">Collaborations with KSWA</h3>
  <p>
    To address this challenge KSWA (Kherwadi Social Welfare Foundation – Yuva
    Parivartan) has developed a concept of converting unsafe Period Huts (Kurma
    Ghars) into Safe Comfortable Holiday Homes for menstruating women by
    recycling plastic bottles. We have been working closely with KSWA since 2017
    in the tribal villages in Palghar to construct individual community toilets
    thereby moving an inch close to making the villages Open Defecation Free
    (ODF). As on date out of the 9 villages 7 villages are ODF.
  </p>
  <h3 class="nl--title">Structure of the Holiday Home</h3>
  <p>
    Each Holiday home will have two sections, namely, the inner room where women
    rest, and the balcony where women relax, and are skilled.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inner room will have five netted windows, an attached toilet, two
    bathrooms, a wash basin, washing section - with a water connection. In
    addition, the room will be equipped with a storage facility for clothes and
    sanitary napkins, solar lighting, solar fan (s), and 8 beds.
  </p>
  <p>
    The balcony will include a corner for skilling women in basic tailoring and
    making of sanitary napkins; seating arrangements, and an upper level clothes
    drying facility.
  </p>
  <p>
    The toilet, two bathrooms, and the washing section of the inner room will be
    in brick while the rest of the structure including the lower 4 feet of the
    balcony will be made of reused one liter plastic bottles filled with soil.
    The top 4 feet of the balcony will be of wire mesh. The beds and seating
    arrangements will be made of reused plastic bottles filled with soil.
    Plastic bottles of proportionate sizes will be reused to create a fencing
    vertical garden with oxygen emitting plants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inner room of the home in discussion (village Tukum ) will be 15 feet x
    19.50 feet, while the balcony will measure 6 feet x 16 feet based on the
    availability of land.
  </p>
  <h3 class="nl--title">Health Education and Awareness</h3>
  <p>
    Based on the available evidence, it is pertinent to follow a strategic
    approach for combating the myths and social taboos associated with
    menstruation in order to improve the reproductive health of adolescent girls
    and women.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first and foremost strategy implemented in this regard is raising the
    awareness among the adolescent girls related to menstrual health and
    hygiene. Young girls often grow up with limited knowledge of menstruation
    because their mothers and other women shy away from discussing the issues
    with them. Adult women may themselves not be aware of the biological facts
    or good hygienic practices, instead passing on cultural taboos and
    restrictions to be observed.
  </p>
  <h3 class="nl--title">Project Monitoring</h3>
  <p>
    As part of the due diligence and project monitoring MMF team ensures that we
    monitor the project on a regular basis and feedback is provided to you (the
    donor). Year on year we have been receiving additional support from Yuva
    Parivartan for on ground inspection and reporting. They have ensured all
    policies and paper work is followed in order to ensure the project is
    successful.
