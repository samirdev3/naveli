    <h3 class="nl--title">The need for a network like EntrepreNaari</h3>
    <p>Despite all the efforts that are being made towards women empowerment, the situation within the entrepreneurial space remains dire. Let’s look at the numbers: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only 3 % of India’s GDP comes from women entrepreneurship </li>
        <li>Just 2 % of all equity funds raised in 2017 went to women-led businesses </li>
        <li>Women-led enterprises account for just 15 . 4 % of the 58.5 million establishments </li>
        <li>About 343 million of Indian women who are of working age do not earn from formal, paid labour This goes to show how important it is to enable women entrepreneurs. When women own businesses, economies grow, employment rates rise and social trajectories change for the better.</li>
    </ul>
