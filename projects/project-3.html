    <h3 class="nl--title">Making legal awareness and mental health support accessible to women pro bono.</h3>
    <p>"Nyay'ri" is a combination of two words - 'Nyay' which means justice and 'Nyaari' which means endearing and unique. Through Project Nyay'ri, we want to uplift and empower women through a unique three-fold process. We provide women assistance on legal awareness, mental health support, and peer-to-peer groups.</p>
    <p>The core principle of Project Nyay'ri is to make legal awareness and mental health support accessible to women. We aim to do this by removing one of the fundamental barriers that hold women back - lack of financial affordability. Therefore, all services under Project Nyay'ri are offered to women pro bono (i.e. free of cost).</p>
    <p>We hope that through this Project, we enable women to feel empowered enough to make informed decisions to seek justice. We are with you on this journey.</p>
    <h3 class="nl--title">01. Legal Awareness</h3>
    <p>Through our legal awareness support, we help women understand their rights and the actions they can take in any particular situation.</p>
    <h3 class="nl--title">02. Mental Health</h3>
    <p>We use mental health support to help women heal from within and feel confident about standing up for themselves.</p>
    <h3 class="nl--title">03. Peer-to-Peer Support Groups</h3>
    <p>Our peer-to-peer support groups create a strong, close-knit community for women to learn from each other's empowering stories and share their experiences.</p>

    <h3 class="nl--title">"We believe that legal rights do not operate in a vacuum. If we want to encourage women to seek justice, we also need to empower them from within to be able to take action and stand up for their rights. Hence, we chose this unique combination of services that tie-in together to uplift women holistically."</h3>
